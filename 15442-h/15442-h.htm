    <p>"CORRECT CARD, GENTS!"&mdash;"Wanted a Map of London" was
    the heading of a letter in the <i>Times</i> last Thursday. No,
    Sir! that's not what is wanted. There are hundreds of 'em,
    specially seductive pocket ones, with just the very streets
    that one wants to discover as short cuts to great centres
    carefully omitted. What <i>is</i> wanted is a <i>correct</i>
    map of London, divided into pocketable sections, portable,
    foldable, durable, on canvas,&mdash;but if imperfect, as so
    many of these small pocket catch-shilling ones are just now,
    although professedly brought up to date '91, they are worse
    than useless, and to purchase one is a waste of time, temper
    and money. We could mention an attractive-looking little
    map&mdash;which, but no&mdash; Publishers and public are hereby
    cautioned! N.B.&mdash;Test well your pocket map through a
    magnifying glass before buying. <i>Experto crede!</i></p>

    <h4><i>In the Bernardino Pass, during the Ascent.</i></h4>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Culch.</i> Glorious view one gets at each fresh turn
        of the road, PODBURY! Look at Hinter-rhein, far down below
        there, like a toy village, and that vast desolate valley,
        with the grey river rushing through it, and the green
        glacier at the end, and these awful snow-covered peaks all
        round&mdash;<i>look</i>, man!</p>

        <p><i>Podb.</i> I'm looking, old chap. It's all there,
        right enough!</p>

        <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>vexed</i>). It doesn't seem to be
        making any particular impression on you, I must say!</p>

        <p><i>Podb.</i> It's making me deuced peckish, I know
        that&mdash;how about lunch, eh!</p>

        <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>pained</i>). We are going through
        scenery like this, and all you think of is&mdash;lunch!
        (PODBURY <i>opens a basket.</i>) You may give me one of
        those sandwiches. What made you get <i>veal</i>? and the
        bread's all crust, too! Thanks, I'll take some claret....
        (<i>They lunch; the vehicle meanwhile toils up to the head
        of the Pass.</i>) Dear me, we're at the top already! These
        rocks shut out the valley altogether&mdash;much colder at
        this height, eh? Don't you find this keen air most
        exhilarating?</p>

        <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>shivering</i>). Oh very, do you mind
        putting your window up? Thanks. You seem uncommon chirpy
        to-day. Beginning to get <i>over</i> it, eh?</p>

        <p><i>Culch.</i> We shan't get over it for some hours
        yet.</p>

        <p><i>Podb.</i> I didn't mean the Pass, I
        meant&mdash;(<i>hesitating</i>)&mdash;well, your little
        affair with Miss PRENDERGAST, you know.</p>

        <p><i>Culch.</i> My little affair? Get over? (<i>He
        suddenly understands.</i>) Oh, ah, to be sure. Yes, thank
        you, my dear fellow, it is not making me
        <i>particularly</i> unhappy. [<i>He goes into a fit of
        silent laughter.</i></p>

        <p><i>Podb.</i> Glad to hear it. (<i>To himself</i>.)
        'Jove, if he only knew what <i>I</i> know! [<i>He
        chuckles.</i></p>

        <p><i>Culch.</i> You don't appear to be exactly
        heartbroken?</p>

        <p><i>Podb.</i> I? why <i>should</i> I be&mdash;about
        <i>what</i>?</p>

        <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>with an affectation of reserve</i>).
        Exactly, I was forgetting. (<i>To himself</i>.) It's really
        rather humorous. (<i>He laughs again.</i>) Ha, we're
        beginning to go down now. Hey for Italy&mdash;la bella
        Italia! (<i>The diligence takes the first curve.</i>) Good
        Heavens, what a turn! We're going at rather a sharp pace
        for downhill, eh? I suppose these Swiss drivers know what
        they're about, though.</p>

        <p><i>Podb.</i> Oh, yes, generally&mdash;when they're not
        drunk. I can only see this fellow's boots&mdash;but they
        look to me a trifle squiffy.</p>

        <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>inspecting them, anxiously</i>). He
        does seem to drive very recklessly. <i>Look</i> at those
        leaders&mdash;heading right for the precipice.... Ah, just
        saved it! How we do lurch in swinging round!</p>

        <p><i>Podb.</i> Topheavy&mdash;I expect, too much luggage
        on board&mdash;have another sandwich?</p>

        <p><i>Culch.</i> Not for me, thanks. I say, I wonder if
        it's safe, having no parapet, only these stone posts,
        eh?</p>

        <p><i>Pod.</i> Safe enough&mdash;unless the wheel catches
        one&mdash;it was as near as a toucher just
        then&mdash;aren't you going to smoke? No? <i>I</i> am. By
        the way, what were you so amused about just now, eh?</p>

        <p><i>Culch.</i> <i>Was</i> I amused? (<i>The vehicle gives
        another tremendous lurch.</i>) Really, this is <i>too</i>
        horrible!</p>

        <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>with secret enjoyment</i>). We're right
        enough, if the horses don't happen to stumble. That
        off-leader isn't over sure-footed&mdash;did you see
        <i>that</i>? (<i>Culch. shudders.</i>) But what's the joke
        about Miss PRENDERGAST?</p>

        <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>irritably</i>). Oh, for Heaven's sake,
        don't bother about that <i>now</i>. I've something else to
        think about. My goodness, we were nearly over that time!
        What are you looking at?</p>

        <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>who has been leaning forward</i>). Only
        one of the traces&mdash;they've done it up with a penny
        ball of string, but I daresay it will stand the strain. You
        aren't <i>half</i> enjoying the view, old fellow.</p>

        <p><i>Culch.</i> Yes, I am.
        Magnificent!&mdash;glorious!&mdash;isn't it?</p>

        <p><i>Podb.</i> Find you see it better with your eyes shut?
        But I say, I wish you'd explain what you were sniggering
        at.</p>

        <p><i>Culch.</i> Take my advice, and don't press me, my
        dear fellow; you may regret it if you do!</p>

        <p><i>Podb.</i> I'll risk it. It must be a devilish funny
        joke to tickle you like that. Come, out with it!</p>

        <p><i>Culch.</i> Well, if you must know, I was laughing....
        Oh, he'll <i>never</i> get those horses round in.... I
        was&mdash;er&mdash;rather amused by your evident assumption
        that I must have been <i>rejected</i> by Miss
        PRENDERGAST.</p>

        <p><i>Podb.</i> Oh, was <i>that</i> it? And you're nothing
        of the kind, eh? [<i>He chuckles again.</i></p>

        <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>with dignity</i>). No doubt you will
        find it very singular; but, as a matter of fact,
        she&mdash;well, she most certainly did not
        <i>discourage</i> my pretensions.</p>

        <p><i>Podb.</i> The deuce she didn't! Did she tell you
        RUSKIN's ideas about courtship being a probation, and ask
        you if you were ready to be under vow for her, by any
        chance?</p>

        <p><i>Culch.</i> This is too bad, PODBURY; you must have
        been there, or you couldn't possibly know!</p>

        <p><i>Podb.</i> Much obliged, I'm sure. I don't listen
        behind doors, as a general thing. I suppose, now, she set
        you a trial of some kind, to prove your mettle, eh?
        [<i>With another chuckle.</i></p>

        <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>furiously</i>). Take care&mdash;or I
        may tell you more than you bargain for!</p>

        <p><i>Podb.</i> Go on&mdash;never mind <i>me</i>. Bless
        you, <i>I'm</i> under vow for her, too, my dear boy.
        Fact!</p>

        <p><i>Culch.</i> That's impossible, and I can prove it. The
        service she demanded was, that I should leave Constance at
        once&mdash;with you. Do you understand&mdash;with
        <i>you</i>, PODBURY!</p>

        <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>with a prolonged whistle</i>). My
        aunt!</p>

        <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>severely</i>). You may invoke every
        female relative you possess in the world, but it won't
        alter the fact, and that alone ought to convince
        you&mdash;</p>

        <p><i>Podb.</i> Hold on a bit. Wait till you've heard
        <i>my</i> penance. She told me to cart <i>you</i> off,
        <i>Now</i>, then!</p>

        <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>faintly</i>). If I thought she'd been
        trifling with us both like that, I'd never&mdash;</p>

        <p><i>Podb.</i> She's no end of a clever girl, you know.
        And, after all, she may only have wanted time to make up
        her mind.</p>

        <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>violently</i>). I tell you <i>what</i>
        she is&mdash;she's a cold-blooded pedantic prig, and a
        systematic flirt! I loathe and detest a prig, but a flirt I
        despise&mdash;yes, <i>despise</i>, PODBURY!</p>

        <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>with only apparent irrelevance</i>).
        The same to you, and many of 'em, old chap! Hullo, we're

    <p><i>Tuesday, October 20th</i>.&mdash;Opening night. <i>Roméo
    et Juliette; débuts</i> of Mlle. SIMMONET, of the Opera
    Comique, and M. COSSIRA, as the lovers. <i>Lady Capulet's</i>
    Small Dance, quite the smartest of the season, as the Veronese
    nobility present were evidently remarking, with abundance of
    easy gesture, to one another, as they led the way to the
    lemonade. The <i>Juliette</i> of the evening charming, and soon
    singing herself into the good graces of a large audience;
    ditto, M. COSSIRA, "than which," as the Prophet NICHOLAS would
    say, "a more competent <i>Roméo</i>&mdash;though perhaps a
    trifle full in the waist for balcony-scaling by moonlight." If
    he had really trusted himself to that gossamer ladder in the
    Fourth Act, he would never have got away to Mantua, especially
    as <i>Juliette</i>, with the thoughtlessness of her age and
    sex, omitted to secure it in any way. Fortunately it was not a
    long drop, and the descent was accomplished without accident,
    as will be seen from the accompanying sketch.</p>

    <p>CHANGE FOR A TENOR.&mdash;Mr. SEYMOUR HADEN, the opponent of

    <hr />

    <h2>ONLY FANCY!</h2>

    <h4>(<i>From Mr. Punch's Own Rumourists.</i>)</h4>

    <p>It may be interesting at this time of the year to mention
    the fact that Lord SALISBURY always uses a poker in cracking
    walnuts. He says it saves the silver. The other day, whilst
    wielding the poker across the walnuts and the wine, Mr.
    GLADSTONE chanced to look in. The Premier, with his well-known
    hospitality, immediately furnished the Right Hon. Gentleman
    with another poker (brought in from the drawing-room), and
    ordered up a fresh supply of nuts.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:25%;">
        <a href="images/209-3.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/209-3.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Mr. GLADSTONE, recurring in private conversation to a recent
    visit paid by him to Lord SALISBURY in Arlington Street,
    questioned the convenience of a poker as an instrument for
    shattering the shell of the walnut. For himself, he says, he
    has always found a pair of tongs more convenient.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The Marquis of HARTINGTON, to whom this remark was reported,
    observed that as a dissentient Liberal he naturally differed
    from Mr. GLADSTONE, and was not to the fullest extent able to
    agree with his noble friend, the Marquis of SALISBURY. For his
    own part, he found the most convenient way of cracking a walnut
    was deftly to place the article in the interstice of the
    dining-room door, and gently close it. He found this plan
    combined with its original purpose a gentle exercise on the
    part of the guests highly conducive to digestion.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Two hours later, the Leader of the Opposition was seen
    walking up Arlington Street, and on reaching Piccadilly, he
    hailed an omnibus, observing the precaution before entering of
    requiring the conductor to produce the scale of charges. "No
    pirate busses for <i>me</i>," the Right Hon. Member remarked,
    as (omitting the oath) he took his seat.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is no secret in official circles that before the vacancy
    in the office of Postmaster-General was filled, it was placed
    at the disposal of the BARON BE BOOK-WORMS. Upon Sir JAMES
    FERGUSSON stepping in, the PRIME MINISTER was urgently desirous
    to have the collaboration of the noble BARON at the Foreign
    Office. But, somehow, the post of Under-Secretary vacated by
    Sir JAMES was assigned to Mr. WILLIAM JAMES LOWTHER.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We are authorised to state that His Imperial Majesty the
    Emperor of GERMANY, feeling the need of a little change, has
    resolved to stay at home for a fortnight.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We are in a position to state that just prior to the General
    Election of 1880, Mr. CHAMBERLAIN was observed standing before
    a cheval glass, alternatively fixing his eyeglass in the right
    eye and in the left. Asked why he should thus quaintly occupy
    his leisure moments, he replied: "It is in view of the General
    Election. If on the platform any person in the crowd poses you
    with an awkward question, should you be able rapidly to
    transfer your eyeglass from your right eye to your left, and
    fix the obtruder with a stony stare, he is so much engaged in
    wondering whether you can keep the glass in position, that he
    forgets what he asked you, and you can pass on to less
    dangerous topics."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>When Mr. SCHOMBERG McDONNELL informed his chief that Lord
    RANDOLPH CHURCHILL had "come upon eight lions," Lord SALISBURY
    sighed and remained for a moment in deep thought. Then he said,
    "How different had the eight lions come upon him!"</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Mr. GLADSTONE has backed himself to walk a mile, talk a
    mile, write a mile, review a mile, disestablish a mile, chop a
    mile and hop a mile in one hour. Sporting circles are much
    interested in the veteran statesman's undertaking, and little
    else is talked about at the chief West End resorts. The general
    opinion of those who ought to know seems to be in favour of the
    scythe-bearer, but not a few have invested a pound or two on
    the Mid-Lothian Marvel.</p>

    <p>There is a judicial review of GEORGE MEREDITH's work in the
    <i>Quarterly</i> for October&mdash;masterly, too, quoth the
    Baron, as striking a balance between effect and defect, and
    finding so much to be duly said in high praise of the diffuse
    and picturesquely-circumnavigating Novelist through whose
    labyrinthine pages the simple Baron finds it hard to thread his
    way, and yet keep the clue. When the unskippingly conscientious
    peruser of GEORGE M.'s novels is most desirous that the author
    shall go ahead, GEORGE, like an Irish cardriver, will stop to
    "discoorse us," and at such length, and so diffusely, and with
    such a wealth of eccentric word-coming and grammar-dodging,
    that at last the Baron gasps, choked by the rolling billows of
    sonorously booming or boomingly sonorous words, battles with
    the waves, ducks, and comes up again breathlessly, wondering
    where he may be, and what it was all about. "Story! God bless
    you, I haven't much to tell, Sir!" says the luxuriantly
    fanciful novel-grinder. And he hasn't much, it must be owned,
    for essenced it would go into half a volume, or less, and all
    over and above is pot-fuls of rich colour, spilt about almost
    at haphazard, permutations and combinations, giving the effect
    of genius. Which&mdash;genius it is; but a little of it goes a
    great way, in fact, a very great way, wandering and straying
    until at length the Baron calls for his <i>Richard Feverel</i>,

    <p>"Water, water everywhere" in the <i>Times</i> recently,
    except when Messrs. GILBEY wrote their annual, and this time
    hopeful, account of the Claret vintage, and when subsequently
    Messrs. "P. and G."&mdash;(who on earth are "P. and
    G."?)&mdash;with a few modest lines at the foot of a page, last
    Wednesday, enlivened our drooping spirits with a brief but
    satisfactory account of Champagne Prospects. If the vintages of
    '86 and '87 are good, and those of '90 and '91 poor, why not
    make a blend? and why not sell it as such? Let "P. and
    G."&mdash;[confound it! who on earth can P. and G. be? "P. and
    J." would be "Punch and Judy"&mdash;and, by the way, in the
    choice <i>Lingua Tuscana</i>, "P. and G." would stand for
    "<i>Poncio è Giulia</i>." But, on the other hand, who,
    unauthorised, would dare to use this signature? No
    matter&mdash;where were we?&mdash;ah!&mdash;to resume.] Let "P.
    and G.," whoe'er they be&mdash;which is rhyme, though not so
    intended&mdash;(but why this masquerade in initials?)&mdash;let
    them exploit a "Blend of '90-cum-'86 and '91-cum-'87," sell it
    as such&mdash;viz., The "P. and G. Blend," or "The Punchius and
    Giulia Blend"&mdash;at a reasonable figure, and thus the
    Not-quite-up-to-the-mark vintages will be saved. Have we not
    seen in City partnerships how a strong house saves a failing
    one, and then the Blends go on successfully? Let "P. and G."
    give us a first-rate Champagne, call it, say, The "G.B.," or
    "Golden Blend," at a reasonable price, and, to drop once again
    into poetry, No matter what their name may be, We'll ever bless

    <h2>CAUGHT BY THE CLASSICS.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>The Record of a Ruined Life.</i>)</h4>

    <p>AUGUSTUS SPARKLER was an exceptionally brilliant man. At
    school he had done marvellously well, and if he did not
    distinguish himself at either of the Universities, it was less
    his fault than his misfortune. When he entered the world, after
    casting off parental control, he took up Medicine. He was a
    great success. He rose by leaps and bounds, until at length it
    was thought highly probable that he would be elected President
    of the Royal College of Physicians. He was sounded upon the
    subject, and a question was put to him.</p>

    <p>"No," he replied, sorrowfully, and then the courteous
    Secretary informed him, with tears in his voice, that he feared
    he was disqualified.</p>

    <p>"Well, I will enter the Navy."</p>

    <p>He did. He passed through the <i>Britannia</i>, and rose by
    leaps and bounds, until it was considered desirable to revive
    the post of Lord High Admiral for his acceptance. But before
    this was done, he was sounded upon the subject, and asked a
    question.</p>

    <p>"No," he again answered, regretfully.</p>

    <p>"I am afraid then, that the scheme must be abandoned,"
    returned the First Civil Lord (he had been chosen as more
    polite than his sea colleagues), and he was almost moved to
    tears in his sadness.</p>

    <p>"I will enter the Army," cried AUGUSTUS, with
    determination.</p>

    <p>And he did. He rose from the ranks in less than no time to
    become a Field Marshal. It was then that a certain Illustrious
    Personage asked him if he would like to become
    Commander-in-Chief.</p>

    <p>"It is not impossible I might resign in your favour," said
    the I.P. And then he asked him the necessary question.</p>

    <p>"No, Sir," returned AUGUSTUS, bowing down his head in shame.
    Again he found that his career was interrupted.</p>

    <p>"I will try the Bar," he shouted.</p>

    <p>And he did. He entered at Gray's Inn, and in a very short
    time became a Q.C., a Judge, and a Lord Justice. Then the
    entire Ministry begged him, as a personal favour, to accept the
    post of Lord Chancellor.</p>

    <p>"With pleasure," was his modest rejoinder. Then he
    remembered that he had been asked a certain question on
    previous occasions, and explained matters.</p>

    <p>"I am afraid you won't do," cried the entire Ministry,
    mournfully.</p>

    <p>"Well, then, I will try the Church."</p>

    <p>And he tried the Church. He became an eminent divine. Every
    one spoke well of him; and when, in due course, the Primacy of
    all England was vacant, he was asked to accept it. Again he
    explained matters.</p>

    <p>"No!" shouted all the Deans and Chapters.</p>

    <p>"You can't mean it!" cried the entire body of
    Archdeacons.</p>

    <p>"Well, I never!" exclaimed every other ecclesiastical
    authority. But it could not be, and the disappointment was too
    much for poor AUGUSTUS, and he died of grief.</p>

    <p>And so they put on the tombstone, that he would have been
    President of the Royal College of Physicians, Lord High
    Admiral, Commander-in-Chief, Lord Chancellor, and Archbishop of
    Canterbury, if&mdash;<i>he had only learned Greek!</i></p>

    <h2>LETTERS TO ABSTRACTIONS.</h2>

    <h3>No. V.&mdash;TO GUSH.</h3>

    <p>MY DEAREST DARLING PERSON,</p>

    <p>How sweet and amiable of you to allow a humble being like
    myself to write to you. Dropping your own special style (which,
    to be perfectly frank with you, I could no more continue
    through the whole of this letter than I could dine off treacle
    and butter-scotch), I beg to say that I am heartily glad to
    have this opportunity of telling you a few things which have
    been on my mind for a long time. In what corner of the great
    realm of abstractions do you make your home? I imagine you
    whiling away the hours on some soft couch of imitation down,
    with a little army of sweet but irrelevant smiles ready at all
    times to do your bidding. You are refined, I am sure. You
    cultivate sympathy as some men cultivate orchids, until it
    blooms and luxuriates in the strangest and gaudiest shapes.
    Your real face is known of no other abstraction; indeed, you
    never see it yourself, so well-fitted and so constant is the
    mask through which you waft the endearments which have caused
    you to be avoided everywhere. This, I admit, is imagination;
    but is it very far from the truth? Perhaps I ask in vain, for
    truth is the very last thing that may be expected of you and of
    those who do your bidding upon earth. I will not, therefore,
    press the question, but proceed at once to business.</p>

    <p>About a month ago I met your friend, ALGERNON JESSAMY. What
    is there about ALGERNON that inspires such distrust? He is very
    presentable; some people have gone so far as to call him
    absolutely good-looking. He is tall, his figure is good, his
    clothes fit him admirably, and are always speckless; his
    features are regular, his complexion fresh, and his fair hair,
    carefully parted in the middle, lies like a smooth and shining
    lid upon his head. I pass over all his remaining advantages,
    whether of dress or of nature. It is enough to say that, thus
    equipped, and with the additional merits of wealth and a good
    position, ALGERNON ought to have found no difficulty in being
    one of the most popular men in town. Perhaps he would have been
    if he had not tried with such a persistent energy to make
    himself "so deuced agreeable." The phrase is not mine, but that
    of SAMMY MIGGS, who has a contempt for ALGERNON and his
    methods, which he never attempts to conceal.</p>

    <p>"ALGY, my boy," I have heard him say, while the unfortunate
    JESSAMY smiled uneasily, and shifted on his seat, "ALGY, my
    boy, I've known you too long to give in to any of your
    nonsense. All that butter of yours is wasted here, so you'd
    better keep it for someone who likes it. Try it on QUISBY," he
    continued, indicating the celebrated actor, who was at that
    moment frowning furiously over a notice of his latest
    performance; "he loves it in firkins, and I'll undertake to say
    you'll never get to the bottom of his swallowing capacity.
    You'll have to exhaust even your stock, ALGY, my boy; and
    that's saying a lot."</p>

    <p>So thoroughly uncomfortable did the suave and gentle
    ALGERNON look, that I afterwards ventured to remonstrate mildly
    with the gadfly MIGGS.</p>

    <p>"What?" he said, "made him uncomfortable, did I? And a jolly
    good job too. Bless you, I know the beggar through and through.
    I wasn't at Oxford with him for nothing. Wish I had been. He's
    the sort of chap who loses no end of I.O.U.'s at cards one
    night, and when he wins piles of ready the next never offers to
    redeem them. You let me alone about ALGY. I tell you I know
    him. There's no bigger humbug in Christendom with all his soft
    sawder and gas about everybody being the dearest and cleverest
    fellow he's ever met. Bah!"</p>

    <p>And therewith SAMMY left me, evidently smarting under some
    ancient sore inflicted by the apparently angelic ALGERNON.</p>

    <p>However, this little incident was not the one I intended to
    narrate. I met ALGY, as I said, about a month ago. It was in
    Piccadilly. At first, as I approached, I thought he did not see
    me, but suddenly he seemed to become aware of my presence. An
    electric thrill of joy ran through him, a smile of heavenly
    welcome irradiated his face, he darted towards me with both
    hands stretched out and almost fell round my neck before all
    the astonished cabmen.</p>

    <p>"My dear, dear fellow," he gasped, apparently struggling
    hard with an overpowering emotion, "this is almost too much. To
    think that I should meet the one man of all others whom I have
    been literally longing to see. Now you simply must walk with me
    for a bit. I can't afford to let you go without having a good
    talk with you. It always refreshes me so to hear your opinions
    of men and things."</p>

    <p>Ignoring my assurance that I had an important appointment to
    keep, he linked his arm closely in mine and dragged me with him
    in the direction from which I had come. How he pattered and
    chattered and flattered. He daubed me over with flattery as I
    have seen bill-stickers brush a hoarding over with paste. Never
    in my life had I felt so small, so mean and such a perfect
    fool, for though I own I have no objection to an occasional
    lollipop of praise, I must say I loathe it in lumps the size of
    a jelly-fish. Yet such is the fare on which JESSAMY compels me
    to subsist. And the annoying part of it was that every lump
    which he crammed down my throat contained an inferential
    compliment to himself, which I was forced either to accept, or
    in declining it to appear a churl. I was never more churlish,
    never less satisfied with myself. Amongst other things we spoke
    of the affairs of "The Dustheap," a little Club of which we
    were both members. JESSAMY opined it was going to the dogs.
    "Just look," he said, "at the men they've got on the Committee;
    mere nobodies. I've always wondered why you are not on it. Men
    like you and me wouldn't make the ridiculous mistakes the
    present lot are constantly making. Fancy their electing
    MUMPLEY, a regular outsider, without enough manners for a
    school-boy. I really don't care about being in the same room
    with him." At this very moment, by one of those curious
    coincidences which invariably happen, the abused MUMPLEY
    himself, a wealthy but otherwise inoffensive stockbroker, hove
    in sight. "There comes the brute himself," said JESSAMY; and in
    another moment his arms were round MUMPLEY's neck, and he was
    protesting, with all the fervour of a heartfelt conviction,
    that MUMPLEY was the one man of all others for whom his heart
    had been yearning. That being so, I left them together, and
    departed to my business.</p>

    <p>Now does JESSAMY imagine that that kind of thing makes him a
    favourite? It must be admitted that he is not very artistic in
    his methods; and I fancy he must sometimes perceive, if I may
    use a homely phrase, that he doesn't go down. But the poor
    beggar can't help himself. He is driven by a force which he
    finds it impossible to resist into the cruel snares that are
    spread for the over-amiable. You, my dear GUSH, are that force,
    and to you, therefore, the sugary JESSAMY owes his failure to
    win the appreciation which he courts so ardently.</p>

    <p>And now I think I have relieved my mind of a sufficient load
    for the time being. If I can remember anything else that might
    interest you, you may count upon me to address you again.
    Permit me in the meantime to subscribe myself with all proper
    curtness,</p>

    <p>Sir,&mdash;I have not seen <i>Pamela's Prodigy</i>, but I
    have just read the criticism in the <i>Times</i>, which says of
    it, "It must be regarded either as a boyish effusion or a sorry
    joke." The criticism then points out how it lacks "wit, humour,
    literary skill," and apparently is wanting in everything that
    goes to make a successful play,&mdash;everything that is,
    except the actors. Mrs. JOHN WOOD was in it: she is a host in
    herself: not only a host, but the Manageress of the theatre
    who, with her partner in the business, is responsible for the
    selection of pieces. Now granting the critic to be
    right&mdash;and, on referring to others, I find a
    <i>consensus</i> of opinion backing him up&mdash;at whose door
    lies the responsibility of having deliberately selected a
    failure? Under what compulsion could so clever and experienced
    an autocrat, sharp as a needle and with the "heye of an 'awk"
    in theatrical matters, as Mrs. JOHN WOOD, have made so fatal a
    mistake&mdash;that is, if the critics are right, and if it be a
    mistake? "<i>To err, is human</i>"&mdash;and, including even
    Mrs. JOHN WOOD, and the critics, we are all human,&mdash;"<i>To
    forgive, divine</i>"&mdash;the critics not being divine could
    not forgive; the public apparently, did forgive&mdash;and,
    will, of course, forget. 'Tis all very well to fall foul of the
    unhappy author&mdash;whom we will not name&mdash;<i>after</i>
    the event; but why was the piece ever chosen, and why was not
    the discovery of its unfitness made during rehearsal? No! "as
    long as the world goes round" these things will happen in the
    best regulated theatres, and experience is apparently no sort
    of guide in such matters.&mdash;Yours faithfully,</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
